Student Data Visualization
Student data Graphical presentation and mailing system
My first ever project on python
I learned python by my on without any help
This project is a Graphical presentaion of data students and also use to send mails 
I use different modules like matplotlib to plot graphs, pandas to read and write an excel file,and smptlib to send emails

my project is a desktop application 
it is a menu base program
it has different types of options to do different functionalities

on the bases of different results of students program plot the graph 
one course has different sections 
my project will plot graph on the bases of different results and can be able to show minimum,maximum,averages of the sections

on the bases of different results weak students can also be identified and automatically send them mail to pay attention on their studies
